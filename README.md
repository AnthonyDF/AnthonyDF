# 🏍️ French second-hand motorcycle market vizualisation dashboard and price prediction.
## 💡 Introduction
The main project that you can find here is the French second-hand motorcycle market vizualisation dashboard and price prediction.
The objective is to predict the price of new motorbike ads and detect good deals 🤑!


The project is composed of micro services such as:
- 🔒 [bike-price](https://github.com/AnthonyDF/bike_price) is a private repo with all my spiders ready to scrap the internet. It's a top secret repo but I can at least detail the stack and strategy 🕵️. I use the famous [scrapy](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrapy) framework to configure and run my spiders 🕷️. They are clever and never scrap twice the same url thanks to a fine tuned middleware. They have a special digestion pipeline to format the data and send it to a postgresql database. They are hosted on a scalable virtual machine aka Digitalocean [droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets) 💧. They are dedicated workers, they wake up early, they go to bed very late and will always listen to what they are asked to do by the cron. Sometimes the task is complex for javascript based websites.  They are smart enough to run a scriptable web browser called [splash](https://github.com/scrapinghub/splash)
